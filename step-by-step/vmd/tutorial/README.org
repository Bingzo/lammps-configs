* Basic vmd usage
vmd needs a file with molecular topology (see [[file:data.psf]]).
data.psf describes a 10 beads linear molecuar with bonds (0-1, 1-2,
2-3 and so on). All atoms are named "A".

Another file [[file:data.dcd]] contains trajectory of the molecuar. To
load files in vmd run
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
vmd -psf data.psf -dcd data.dcd
#+END_SRC
to get vmd shell as emacs tcl shell execute.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; FIXME: cannot make it without a file
(inferior-tcl "./r.sh")
#+END_SRC

* vmd commands
** animate
*These commands control the animation of a molecular trajectory and
are used to read and write animation frames to/from a file or
Play/Pause/Rewind a molecular trajectory.*
